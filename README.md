# Minesweeper
This is my implementation of Minesweeper game.  
You can also save your game to a file. While playing if you type "s" you can give a name of a file to save the game to.  
You can resume the game by typing  
```
ruby game.rb name_of_the_file_where_game_is_saved  
```
If you just type  
```
ruby game.rb  
```
, it will start a new game.
